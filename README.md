## By Gustaw Eriksson, gustaw.eriksson@ki.se
A quick and dirty run of the DESeq2 vignette on the parsilla dataset. Please download the DESeq2_workshop.Rmd from /docs and open it in RStudio. If ypu do not want to run the code, you can download either the .html or .pdf file.

If R and Rstudio is not installed, you can install R from here; https://www.r-project.org/ and RStudio from here; https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

After opening DESeq2_workshop.Rmd install BiocManager (done automatically) and the required packages by changing the install.packages.flag from TRUE to FALSE. 

Thereafter, run all the code section to generate output. 

The tutorial is fully based on DESeq2 vignette by Love et al. found here: http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#data-quality-assessment-by-sample-clustering-and-visualization

Enjoy!
